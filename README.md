# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-in-Low-Energy-Residential-Buildings
This repository contains code for predicting energy consumption in a low-energy residential building using a dataset with 19,000+ records measured every 10 minutes. We use Random Forest and LSTM models, focusing on feature selection and performance evaluation to develop accurate and robust predictions.
